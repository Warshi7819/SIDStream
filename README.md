Remember the late 90's? Finally a new shaped Windows Forms application is here! This beauty will let you play 
those retro SID music files! 

What is SID? You unthought man of little skill! SID is a music file format (of sorts) commonly known to house Commodore 64 music!

## Overview

SIDStreamer lets you load and play SID music files! It doesn't get more retro than that. 

## Credits
 - Turns out that I did not write the sid player part of this project! This was written ages ago for the Microsof.XNA library and made open source by what I believe was Ken Händel. But it has later been taken down probably because the Microsoft.XNA library is deprecated long ago. Anyways, credit to Mr. Ken Händel for writing the original SidPlayer code! 
 - Once the MonoGame framework came along I did some super tiny modifications to the original code so that it now works again! And if my memory serves me correct I may have renamed it from SidPlayer to MonoSidPlayer.

## Features

- Load and play a given SID file (.sid)
- Playback controls: Play, Stop, Next, Previous

## Requirements

- .NET 10
- Windows 10 or later
- Visual Studio 2026 (recommended) or compatible IDE
- MonoGame Framework

## Upcoming Features
- Theme support, and a default theme instead of the christmas vibes the current one have?
- Playlist support. Probably a long shot because.. when does a SID file really end?
- Possible integration with High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC) and do some real SIDstreaming?
