Remember the 90's? Finally a new shaped Windows Forms application is here! This beauty will let you play 
those retro SID music files! 

What is SID? You unthought man of little skill! SID is a music file format (of sorts) commonly known to house Commodore 64 music!

## Overview

SIDStreamer lets you load and play SID music files! It doesn't get more retro than that. 

## Credits
 - Turns out that I did not write the sid player part of this project! This was written ages ago for the Microsof.XNA library and made open source. But the dude that made it available all those years ago apparently has taken it down. Probably because the Microsoft.XNA library is deprecated and dead. Anyways, credit to Mr. "XYZ" for writing the original SID player code! 
 - Once the MonoGame framework came along I did some super tiny modifications to the original code so that it now works again! And if my memory serves me correct I may have renamed it from SidPlayer to MonoSidPlayer.
